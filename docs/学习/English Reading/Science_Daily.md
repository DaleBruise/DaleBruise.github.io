## [New DESI results strengthen hints that dark energy may evolve](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/03/250320214311.htm) 2025.3.22

### "What we are seeing is deeply intriguing," said Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, co-spokesperson for DESI and a professor at UC Santa Cruz. "It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe."

- intriguing adj. 令人好奇的
- cusp n. 转折点

### Taken alone, DESI's data are consistent with our standard model of the universe

- consistent adj. 一贯的

### However, when paired with other measurements, there are mounting indications that the impact of dark energy may be weakening over time and that other models may be a better fit.

- mounting adj. 增长的，上升的
- indication n. 迹象

### Events in the very early universe left subtle patterns in how matter is distributed, a feature called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO).

- subtle adj. 轻微的；精妙的

###  "As our data are getting more and more precise, we're finding potential cracks in the model and realizing we may need something new to explain all the results together."

- crack n. 裂缝

### Other experiments coming online over the next several years will also provide complementary datasets for future analyses.

- complementary adj. 互助的；相互辅佐的



## [Why don't we remember being a baby? New study provides clues](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/03/250320144619.htm) 2025.3.23

### The findings, published March 20 in _Science,_ indicate that memories can indeed be encoded in our brains in our first years of life.

- indicate v. 表明

### And in past animal studies, researchers have shown that the statistical learning pathway, which is found in the more anterior part of the hippocampus (the area closer to the front of the head), develops earlier than that of episodic memory.

- anterior adj. 前部的


## [A new robotic gripper made of measuring tape is sizing up fruit and veggie picking](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250409154638.htm) 2025.4.19

- gripper n. 爪子；钳子

### The grippers would be a particularly good fit for agriculture applications, as their extremities are soft enough to grab fragile fruits and vegetables, researchers wrote.

- extremity n. 四肢

### Existing grippers that can expand are bulky because they need additional mechanisms to get gripping appendages to expand.

- bulky adj. 笨拙的；大块头的

### Each spool is rolled up, in a compact configuration, with only a small part extending out in a triangle shape to form a finger.

- compact adj.小型的；紧凑的
- spool n. 卷轴

### The researchers had already worked with measuring tape as part of a grant from the National Science Foundation to investigate soft materials that could bend while holding their shape. Measuring tape is springy -- you can bend it any way you want and it goes back to its original state.

- grant n. 补助金；土地
- springy adj. 有弹力的
